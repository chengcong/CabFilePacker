# CabFilePacker
A Command Line Tool for creating .cab files from files in directory.
I wrote this smal tool for an InfoPath project. The usecase was to unpack the *.xsn file, modify some files in it and then
repack the files into an InfoPath file.

## Usage
1. Compile the project with Visual Studio.
1. Run the *CabFilePacker.exe* and follow the instructions on the screen.
1. *CabFilePacker.exe* will pack all files in the specified folder to an *InfoPathFile.xsn* file. You can rename the file to whatever you like.
